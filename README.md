# Skinopatra
## Introduction
Welcome to Skinopatra, a skincare brand that has cautiously created idea of conveying nature to your doorstep.We trust that nobody ought to need to trade off their wellbeing for beauty.

The project is an e-commerce domain focusing on products and product reviews. We have three models: User, Review, and Product. A Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.

Product - User is a many to many relationship.

## Goals
* Use Active Record to interact with a database.
* Have a minimum of two models with a one-to-many relationship.
* Create API routes in Sinatra that handles at least three different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
* Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions. 

## Technologies used
1. Ruby
2. Sinatra
3. SQLite3

### Migrations
Created a migration for the products, users and reviews table.

A product has many users and many reviews through users. A user has many reviews and many products through reviews.

A Review belongs to a Product, and a Review also belongs to a User. In the migration, created user id column and product id column in reviews table to establish these relationships.
The reviews table should also have:
A star_rating column that stores an integer.
A comment column that stores a string.


### Object Association Methods
Used Active Record association macros and Active Record query methods (i.e. has_many, has_many through, and belongs_to).
